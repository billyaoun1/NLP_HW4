    "Homework 4: Neural Language Models (& 🎃 SpOoKy 👻 authors 🧟 data)\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Due date: Tuesday, June 3rd, 2025 @ 9pm Boston time\n",
    "\n",
    "Points: 132.5 (see Canvas for breakdown)\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    "- explore & use word embeddings\n",
    "- train neural models from the ground up!\n",
    "- get comfy with a modern neural net library (`pytorch`)\n",
    "    - you'll likelye make close friends with the docs: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html \n",
    "- evaluate neural vs. vanilla n-gram language models\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete in groups of: __two__. If you prefer to work on your own, you may, but be aware that this homework has been designed as a partner project!\n",
    "\n",
    "Allowed python modules:\n",
    "- `gensim`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pytorch`, `nltk`, `pandas`, `sci-kit learn` (`sklearn`), `seaborn`, all built-in python libraries (e.g. `math` and `string`), and anything else we imported in the starter code\n",
    "- if you would like to use a library not on this list, post on piazza to request permission\n",
    "- all *necessary* imports have been included for you (all imports that we used in our solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "- Complete outlined problems in this notebook. \n",
    "- When you have finished, __clear the kernel__ and __run__ your notebook \"fresh\" from top to bottom. Ensure that there are __no errors__. \n",
    "    - If a problem asks for you to write code that does result in an error (as in, the answer to the problem is an error), leave the code in your notebook but commented out so that running from top to bottom does not result in any errors.\n",
    "- Double check that you have completed Task 0.\n",
    "- Submit your work on Gradescope.\n",
    "- Double check that your submission on Gradescope looks like you believe it should __and__ that all partners are included (for partner work).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data processing:\n",
    "- You may __choose__ how you would like to tokenize your text for this assignment\n",
    "- You'll want to __deal with internal commas (commas inside of the sentences) appropriately__ when you read in the data, so use the python [`csv` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) or some other module to read the csv in (vs. splitting on commas).\n",
    "\n",
    "Warnings:\n",
    "- You might see:\n",
    "```\n",
    "notebook controller is DISPOSED. \n",
    "View Jupyter log for further details.\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is not an error per se--go to the last cell that ran successfully (or the first cell) and run them one-by-one, waiting for the prior one to finish running before moving to the next.\n"
